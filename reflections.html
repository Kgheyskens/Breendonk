    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <p>
        There are things you think you understand before you see them. You read the numbers, you study the facts, you look at photographs in textbooks. And then you walk into a place like Fort Breendonk, and you realize that understanding was only the surface. The reality — the cold, the darkness, the weight of the concrete pressing down from every direction — reaches something deeper than knowledge. It reaches the part of you that feels.

    <!-- On Sanitary Conditions -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>On the Humiliation of the Body</h2>
      <div class="reflection-block">
        <p>
          I stood in the room where the sanitary facilities had been, and I tried to imagine what it would mean to share a single barrel with eleven other people — in full view of guards, of fellow prisoners, of anyone who happened to pass. I tried, and I could not fully imagine it. That is perhaps the point. The humiliation was designed to be beyond what a person could prepare for, beyond what the mind could rationalize. It was not a failure of infrastructure. It was a deliberate act of erasure — an attempt to convince human beings that they were no longer human.
        </p>
        <p>
          What struck me most was not just the physical degradation, but the calculated nature of it. Someone designed these conditions. Someone decided that this level of debasement was appropriate, even necessary. That thought is harder to sit with than the damp and the cold.

    <!-- On Torture -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>On the Reality of Systematic Torture</h2>
      <div class="reflection-block">
        <p>
          In the interrogation rooms, the air feels different. I do not know if that is my imagination or if places truly absorb something of what happens within them. But standing there, looking at the hooks on the walls, the restraints, the bare concrete — I felt a kind of silence that was not peaceful. It was the silence of something that has been screamed into and then gone quiet.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had read that bullets were considered too expensive for the prisoners. That single fact stayed with me long after I left the fort. It is one thing to comprehend violence; it is another to comprehend a system so thoroughly indifferent to human life that the cost of a bullet becomes the deciding factor. That is not cruelty born of passion — it is cruelty born of accounting.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not think I will forget the feeling of standing in that room. I do not think I should.

    <!-- On the Atmosphere -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>On the Atmosphere Inside the Fort</h2>
      <div class="reflection-block">
        <p>
          Fort Breendonk is not a museum in the conventional sense. There are no bright lights, no carefully curated displays behind glass. The fort <em>is</em> the exhibit. You walk through the same corridors the prisoners walked. You stand in the same cells. You look up at the same low ceilings that pressed down on people who had done nothing wrong but exist in a time and place where that was enough to condemn them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The darkness inside the fort is not just an absence of light — it is a presence. It fills the hallways and the rooms and the stairwells with a heaviness that makes you slow down, that makes you lower your voice without being asked. I noticed that everyone around me did the same. No one needed to be told to be quiet. The fort teaches you silence on its own terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          I kept thinking: people lived here. Not for a day or an afternoon visit, but for weeks, months. In this cold. In this dark. Without knowing if they would ever leave. That thought changed the way I experienced every room I entered after that.

    <!-- On Power and Moral Complexity -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>On the Contrast Between Prisoners and Authority</h2>
      <div class="reflection-block">
        <p>
          One of the most difficult aspects of learning about Breendonk is the stark asymmetry of power. On one side, prisoners stripped of every right, every comfort, every shred of autonomy. On the other, men in uniforms with absolute authority over life and death. The SS officers, the guards, the Flemish collaborators — they walked these same corridors with entirely different experiences. For them, this was a workplace. For the prisoners, it was a place of annihilation.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then there are the figures who do not fit neatly into either category. Oskar Hoffman, the blacksmith who was given privileges in exchange for his labour — what do we make of him? It is easy, from a distance, to draw moral lines. But in the reality of Breendonk, where survival itself was an act of negotiation with an inhuman system, those lines blur. I do not think it is our place to judge the choices made by people whose circumstances we cannot truly comprehend. But I do think it is our responsibility to acknowledge the complexity — to resist the temptation to simplify the past into heroes and villains alone.

    <!-- On Discomfort -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>On the Importance of Discomfort</h2>
      <div class="reflection-block">
        <p>
          I left Fort Breendonk feeling unsettled. Not frightened, not horrified in the dramatic sense — but deeply, quietly unsettled. The kind of discomfort that does not go away when you step back into the sunlight and get into a warm car. The kind that follows you home and sits with you at dinner and is still there when you wake up the next morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have come to believe that this discomfort is not a flaw of the experience — it is the purpose. If we can learn about places like Breendonk and feel nothing, then something has failed. The discomfort is a signal that our moral sense is still functioning, that we have not become so accustomed to stories of atrocity that they no longer reach us. It is a sign that we are still capable of recognizing injustice, even when it is historical rather than immediate.
        </p>
        <p>
          History is not meant to be comfortable. Particularly history like this. The moment we learn about the suffering of others without feeling the weight of it — even partially, even imperfectly — is the moment we begin to lose the very thing that separates us from the indifference that made places like Breendonk possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not want to be comfortable with what I saw. And I hope that those who visit after me feel the same.
