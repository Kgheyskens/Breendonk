    <!-- Construction -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>Construction of the Fort (1906–1914)</h2>
      <p>
        Fort Breendonk was constructed between 1906 and 1914 as part of the fortified position of Antwerp (<em>Stelling van Antwerpen</em>), a ring of military fortifications designed to defend the Belgian port city in the event of foreign invasion. Situated between the Rupel and Nete rivers in the municipality of Willebroek, the fort was built using reinforced concrete and brick, incorporating modern defensive architecture of the early twentieth century.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fort was designed to accommodate a garrison and to serve as a strongpoint in Belgium's national defense strategy. It saw limited military action during the First World War before Belgium's capitulation in 1914. In the interwar period, the fort was maintained but not significantly modernized.

    <!-- German Occupation -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>The German Occupation and Transformation (1940)</h2>
      <p>
        On 10 May 1940, Nazi Germany invaded Belgium, and the country fell under German occupation within weeks. Fort Breendonk, which had briefly served as the headquarters of the Belgian army, was seized by the German military authorities. In September 1940, the fort was designated as an <em>Auffanglager</em> (reception camp) under the control of the <strong>Sicherheitspolizei und Sicherheitsdienst</strong> (SIPO-SD) — the Nazi security police and intelligence service.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fort's thick concrete walls and isolated location made it an ideal site for detention and interrogation. Over the course of the occupation, approximately 3,600 prisoners passed through Breendonk. These included political prisoners, resistance fighters, Jews, Roma, and others deemed enemies of the Reich. For many, Breendonk served as a transit point before deportation to concentration camps in Germany and occupied Poland — including Buchenwald, Mauthausen, and Auschwitz.

    <!-- Daily Life -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>Daily Life in the Camp</h2>

      <h3>Living Conditions</h3>
      <p>
        The conditions inside Fort Breendonk were deliberately designed to degrade and dehumanize. Prisoners were housed in dark, damp barracks with minimal ventilation. The rooms were overcrowded, and the concrete structure retained cold and moisture throughout the year. Bedding was sparse, and prisoners slept on straw-covered wooden platforms.
      </p>

      </div>

      <h3>Sanitary Facilities</h3>
      <p>
        The sanitary conditions were appalling. Dozens of prisoners were forced to share a single barrel as a toilet — accounts describe as many as <strong>twelve prisoners sharing one barrel at the same time</strong>. Privacy was nonexistent. The lack of adequate hygiene facilities contributed to the spread of disease and added to the systematic humiliation that defined daily life in the camp.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p class="img-caption">The sanitary conditions were designed to strip prisoners of all dignity.</p>

      <h3>Food and Starvation</h3>
      <p>
        Prisoners received starvation rations. A typical day's food consisted of <strong>two slices of dark war bread</strong> and a thin, watery soup. What passed for coffee was a bitter drink made from <strong>roasted acorns</strong> — a substitute that provided no nourishment. The deliberate deprivation of adequate food left prisoners in a state of chronic weakness, making them more vulnerable to disease, forced labour, and abuse.
      </p>

      <h3>Forced Labour</h3>
      <p>
        Prisoners were subjected to exhausting forced labour, including digging and moving heavy earth to enlarge the fort's defenses. This back-breaking work was carried out under constant surveillance and abuse. Prisoners who collapsed from exhaustion were beaten. The labour served both a practical military purpose and a punitive one — it was a tool of destruction through work.

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <!-- Torture and Execution -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>Torture and Execution</h2>
      <p>
        Torture was not an exception at Fort Breendonk — it was <strong>systematic and routine</strong>. Prisoners were subjected to severe beatings, suspension from poles, water torture, and prolonged standing. The interrogation rooms became places of unimaginable suffering. The stated aim of torture was to extract information about resistance networks, but it was also employed as a tool of terror and subjugation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Survivors have testified that <strong>bullets were considered "too expensive"</strong> for the killing of prisoners. This chilling remark reveals the extent to which human life was devalued within the camp's hierarchy. Prisoners selected for execution were often subjected to additional degradation beforehand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before executions, a <strong>blue sack was placed over the prisoner's head</strong> — not as an act of mercy, but to prevent other prisoners from recognizing the condemned and to maintain secrecy about who had been killed. This practice deepened the atmosphere of fear and uncertainty that pervaded the camp.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bodies of executed prisoners were transported to the <strong>National Shooting Range</strong> (<em>Nationaal Schietplein</em>) in Brussels, where they were buried in unmarked or mass graves. Many families did not learn the fate of their loved ones until after the war — if at all.

    <!-- Key Individuals -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>Individuals of Note</h2>
      <p>
        The history of Fort Breendonk is not only the history of a place — it is the history of people. Both the victims and the perpetrators must be named and remembered, for different but equally important reasons.
      </p>

      <h3>Prisoners</h3>

      <div class="card fade-in">
        <h4>Walter Obling — Prisoner No. 30</h4>
        <p>
          Walter Obling was registered as the 30th prisoner at Fort Breendonk. His early arrival places him among the first detainees of the camp, enduring conditions before any international attention or structure of resistance had formed inside the walls. His designation as "Prisoner No. 30" underscores the bureaucratic dehumanization that reduced individuals to numbers.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card fade-in">
        <h4>François Vanderveld</h4>
        <p>
          François Vanderveld was among the prisoners held at Breendonk. His experiences within the camp reflect the broader suffering endured by political detainees and resistance members who were imprisoned for their opposition to the Nazi occupation of Belgium.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card fade-in">
        <h4>Paul Hermans</h4>
        <p>
          Paul Hermans was detained at Fort Breendonk as a prisoner of the Nazi regime. Like many others, his imprisonment was part of the broader campaign to suppress resistance and dissent in occupied Belgium. His story contributes to the collective memory of those who suffered at the hands of the SIPO-SD.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card fade-in">
        <h4>Oskar Hoffman — The Blacksmith</h4>
        <p>
          Oskar Hoffman occupied a unique and morally complex position within the camp. A prisoner himself, Hoffman worked as a <strong>blacksmith</strong> and was afforded certain privileges by the camp authorities in exchange for his skilled labour. His situation illustrates the agonizing moral dilemmas faced by prisoners who were forced to navigate a system designed to destroy them — where cooperation could mean survival, and survival could carry the weight of guilt.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Camp Personnel</h3>

      <div class="card fade-in">
        <h4>Adolf Singer — Camp Doctor</h4>
        <p>
          Adolf Singer served as the camp doctor at Fort Breendonk. The role of medical personnel in the camp system was deeply paradoxical: tasked with maintaining a semblance of medical care in an environment where the deliberate destruction of health was policy. Accounts suggest that medical treatment was minimal and that the doctor's presence served more as a formality than a genuine effort to preserve prisoner welfare.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card fade-in">
        <h4>SS Lieutenant Braus</h4>
        <p>
          SS Lieutenant Braus held a position of authority at Fort Breendonk and was directly involved in the administration of the camp. Figures like Braus were instrumental in implementing the policies of repression, forced labour, and violence that characterized the camp's operation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card fade-in">
        <h4>Adolf — A Flemish SS Member</h4>
        <p>
          Among the camp personnel was a Flemish SS member known as Adolf. His presence at Breendonk is a reminder that collaboration with the Nazi regime was not limited to German nationals. Local collaborators played significant roles in the machinery of repression, and their involvement raises difficult questions about complicity, loyalty, and moral responsibility within occupied societies.

    <!-- Prison Cells and Memorial -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>The Cells and the Memorial</h2>
      <p>
        The prison cells of Fort Breendonk ranged from cramped individual isolation cells — where prisoners were confined in total darkness for days or weeks — to larger communal rooms where overcrowding was severe. The cells were unheated, and the thick concrete walls ensured that the cold and damp were inescapable.
      </p>

      <p class="img-caption">The cells of Fort Breendonk: isolation and communal confinement.</p>

      <p>
        After the liberation of Belgium in September 1944, Fort Breendonk was preserved as a national memorial. The Belgian government recognized the importance of maintaining the site in its original state as a testament to the crimes committed within its walls. Today, visitors can walk through the same corridors, cells, and courtyard that prisoners once inhabited.
