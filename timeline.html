          Construction of Fort Breendonk Begins
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-body">
          <p>
            Construction of Fort Breendonk begins as part of Belgium's fortified defense line around Antwerp. The fort is designed as a large, reinforced concrete structure capable of withstanding modern artillery fire. It forms one link in a chain of fortifications intended to protect the city from invasion. The project represents Belgium's commitment to military preparedness in an era of rising European tensions.
          </p>
          <p class="timeline-reflection">
            A structure built to protect a nation would, decades later, become a place where the very concept of protection was violently denied to those held within.

          <p>
            The fort is completed shortly before the outbreak of the First World War. During the German advance into Belgium in 1914, Fort Breendonk sees limited action as part of the defense of Antwerp. After Belgium's capitulation, the fort falls into relative disuse. Between the wars, it remains a military property but is not significantly modernized or reinforced.
          </p>
          <p class="timeline-reflection">
            The fort's first encounter with war would prove to be only a prelude to the far greater horrors that awaited it in the next conflict.

          <p>
            On 10 May 1940, Nazi Germany launches its invasion of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Within eighteen days, the Belgian army capitulates. King Leopold III surrenders, and Belgium falls under German military occupation. Fort Breendonk, which had briefly served as the Belgian army's headquarters during the invasion, is seized by German forces.
          </p>
          <p class="timeline-reflection">
            The speed of Belgium's fall left its citizens in shock — and left thousands vulnerable to a regime that would systematically dismantle their rights, their safety, and their lives.

          First Prisoners Arrive at Breendonk
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-body">
          <p>
            Fort Breendonk is officially designated as an <em>Auffanglager</em> (reception camp), and the first prisoners are brought through its gates. Among the earliest detainees is Walter Obling, registered as prisoner number 30. The initial prisoners are primarily political detainees, suspected resistance members, and individuals considered threats to the occupation. The camp begins its transformation from an empty military structure into a site of terror.
          </p>
          <p class="timeline-reflection">
            Each number assigned to a prisoner erased a name, a history, a life — and replaced it with the cold arithmetic of a system designed to dehumanize.

        <div class="timeline-body">
          <p>
            The Sicherheitspolizei und Sicherheitsdienst (SIPO-SD) — the Nazi security police and intelligence service — assumes full operational control of Fort Breendonk. Under their authority, the camp develops a systematic regime of interrogation, forced labour, and torture. SS personnel, including SS Lieutenant Braus and local Flemish collaborators, staff the camp. A rigid hierarchy is established in which prisoners are completely subject to the arbitrary power of their captors.
          </p>
          <p class="timeline-reflection">
            The bureaucratization of cruelty gave it structure, routine, and — most disturbingly — the appearance of normalcy for those who carried it out.

          Expansion of the Prisoner Population
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-body">
          <p>
            As the German occupation deepens and resistance activity grows, the number of prisoners at Breendonk increases significantly. The camp holds political prisoners, members of resistance networks, communists, Jews, Roma, and hostages. By this period, forced labour — including the brutal excavation work to reinforce the fort — becomes a central feature of camp life. Prisoners endure starvation rations, disease, overcrowding, and systematic violence. Figures such as Oskar Hoffman, the blacksmith, navigate the camp's internal hierarchy with certain limited privileges.
          </p>
          <p class="timeline-reflection">
            The expansion of suffering was not incidental — it was policy, designed to crush not only bodies but the will to resist.

        <div class="timeline-body">
          <p>
            From 1942 onward, Breendonk increasingly functions as a transit camp. Prisoners are deported to concentration camps across the Reich, including Buchenwald, Mauthausen, Neuengamme, and Auschwitz-Birkenau. Simultaneously, executions take place at the fort itself. Prisoners are led to execution with a blue sack placed over their heads. The bodies are transported to the National Shooting Range in Brussels for burial. Families are often left without knowledge of their loved ones' fates.
          </p>
          <p class="timeline-reflection">
            For many prisoners, Breendonk was not the end of their suffering — it was the beginning of a journey into an even darker abyss.

          <p>
            In early September 1944, Allied forces advance through Belgium and Brussels is liberated on 3 September. Fort Breendonk is reached and liberated shortly thereafter. The remaining prisoners are freed, and the full extent of the conditions within the camp becomes known. The site is immediately recognized as evidence of Nazi war crimes in Belgium. Investigations begin, and survivor testimonies are recorded.

            Liberation brought freedom, but it could not undo what had been endured — the scars, both visible and invisible, would remain for a lifetime.

          <p>
            In 1947, the Belgian government officially declares Fort Breendonk a national memorial. The decision is made to preserve the fort in its wartime state, allowing future generations to witness the conditions in which prisoners lived and died. The memorial opens to the public, and educational programmes are gradually developed. Fort Breendonk becomes one of the most important sites of World War II remembrance in Western Europe.
          </p>
          <p class="timeline-reflection">
            By choosing to preserve Breendonk, Belgium made a commitment — not only to its past, but to the generations who would inherit the responsibility of remembering.

            In the decades since its designation as a memorial, Fort Breendonk has served as a site of education, remembrance, and reflection. Thousands of visitors — including school groups, researchers, survivors, and their descendants — visit the fort each year. The memorial has been expanded with informational exhibitions, survivor testimony archives, and guided tours. It continues to play a vital role in Belgium's engagement with its wartime past and in the broader European effort to remember the Holocaust and Nazi persecution.

            A memorial is not a conclusion — it is an ongoing conversation between the past and the present, demanding that each generation find its own way to listen.
