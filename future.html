    <!-- Why Remembrance Matters -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>Why Remembrance Matters</h2>
      <p>
        The past does not disappear simply because time has passed. The events that took place at Fort Breendonk — the imprisonment, the torture, the executions, the deportations — are not distant abstractions confined to a chapter in a history book. They are part of the lived experience of real people, many of whom have surviving family members and descendants who carry the weight of that history today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remembrance is not a passive act. It is not merely the preservation of dates and facts, though those matter. True remembrance requires engagement — a willingness to confront difficult truths, to ask uncomfortable questions, and to accept that the systems that made Breendonk possible were not aberrations of a distant era. They were built by human decisions, maintained by human compliance, and carried out by human hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        To remember Fort Breendonk is to acknowledge that the capacity for cruelty exists within every society — and that the only meaningful defense against it is an active commitment to the values that cruelty seeks to destroy: dignity, justice, empathy, and the rule of law.

    <!-- Lessons Learned -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>Lessons Learned from Breendonk</h2>
      <p>
        Fort Breendonk teaches many lessons, but perhaps the most important are the quietest — the ones that do not announce themselves but settle in gradually, the way the cold of the fort's corridors settles into your body.
      </p>

      <div class="card fade-in">
        <h3>The danger of dehumanization</h3>
        <p>
          Every atrocity begins with the belief that certain people are less than human. At Breendonk, prisoners were reduced to numbers, stripped of their names, their possessions, their dignity. This process of dehumanization was not incidental to the violence — it was the precondition for it. When we encounter language or policies that categorize people as inferior, as threats, as less deserving of rights, we must recognize it for what it is: the first step on a path that history has shown us leads to catastrophe.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card fade-in">
        <h3>The complicity of silence</h3>
        <p>
          Breendonk did not operate in a vacuum. It existed within a network of institutions, personnel, and — critically — a broader society that allowed it to function. Some collaborated actively; many others simply looked away. The lesson is not that every bystander bears equal responsibility, but that silence and indifference create the conditions in which atrocity can flourish. The absence of opposition is itself a form of permission.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card fade-in">
        <h3>The fragility of rights</h3>
        <p>
          The rights that prisoners at Breendonk lost — the right to safety, to a fair trial, to bodily integrity, to life itself — were not theoretical concepts. They were protections that existed in law and were systematically dismantled by a regime that had seized power. This reminds us that rights are not self-sustaining. They require institutions to enforce them, citizens to defend them, and a culture that values them not merely in principle but in practice.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card fade-in">
        <h3>The moral complexity of survival</h3>
        <p>
          The story of Breendonk includes not only clear-cut victims and perpetrators, but also figures who inhabited morally ambiguous positions — prisoners who received privileges, collaborators who had varied motivations, individuals who made impossible choices under impossible circumstances. This complexity does not diminish the horror of what occurred; rather, it deepens our understanding of how systems of oppression function and how they implicate people at every level.

    <!-- Human Dignity and Democracy -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>Human Dignity and Democracy</h2>
      <p>
        At its core, the story of Fort Breendonk is about what happens when human dignity is systematically denied. The prisoners who entered the fort were citizens, parents, workers, thinkers, and believers. Inside, they were treated as objects — to be used, broken, and discarded. The regime that created Breendonk did not merely violate laws; it violated the fundamental principle that every human being possesses inherent worth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Democracy is, in its essence, the political expression of that principle. It is the system that says: every person has a voice, every person has rights, and no authority exists that is above accountability. When democratic institutions are weakened — through corruption, polarization, authoritarianism, or apathy — the protections that stand between citizens and the abyss begin to erode. Breendonk shows us what lies at the end of that erosion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The defense of democracy, then, is not an abstract political exercise. It is a moral imperative, rooted in the same understanding that leads us to stand in silence before the cells of Breendonk: that every life matters, and that any system which denies this truth must be resisted.

    <!-- Hopeful but Realistic Ending -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>A Way Forward</h2>
      <p>
        It would be dishonest to end a reflection on Fort Breendonk with simple optimism. The world that produced the horrors of the Second World War has not disappeared. Conflicts, persecution, and violations of human rights continue in many parts of the globe. The forces that drove the events at Breendonk — nationalism, prejudice, the thirst for power, the willingness to dehumanize — remain present in human societies.
      </p>
      <p>
        And yet, there is something meaningful in the fact that places like Breendonk exist as memorials. That societies choose to preserve the evidence of their darkest moments, rather than erasing them, is itself a form of resistance — a refusal to let the past be forgotten or sanitized. Every visitor who walks through those corridors and allows themselves to feel the weight of what happened there is participating in an act of remembrance that matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        The future is not predetermined. It will be shaped by the choices of individuals and communities — by what we choose to remember, what we choose to teach, and what we choose to stand for. The legacy of Breendonk does not demand perfection. It demands awareness. It demands the courage to look at difficult truths without turning away. And it demands that we carry those truths forward, not as burdens alone, but as commitments: to dignity, to justice, and to the belief that what happened at Breendonk must never be allowed to happen again.

    <!-- Group Conclusion -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>A Collective Responsibility</h2>
      <div class="reflection-block" style="border-left-color: var(--clr-accent);">
        <p>
          We did not choose the history we inherited, but we do choose what we do with it. As students, as citizens, as human beings, we carry a responsibility that extends beyond ourselves — a responsibility to those who suffered, to those who survived, and to those who will come after us. Fort Breendonk has shown us what indifference and cruelty can create. It falls to us — all of us, together — to build something different: a future grounded in empathy, in knowledge, in the unwavering conviction that every person deserves to live in dignity and freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
          We leave this subject not with closure, but with purpose. The silence of Breendonk is not the end of the conversation. It is the beginning of ours.
